    "How do I apply for a vacation placement or training contract?": "All applications must be made online using the ‘Apply’ section of the graduate website. Candidates who undertake a vacation scheme will automatically be considered for a training contract and so are not required to make a separate training contract application.",
    "I am completing a Law degree – does it matter what modules I choose to study?": "Pinsent Masons does not stipulate that you need to have studied particular modules as part of your undergraduate studies, however, we would expect that students who are keen to pursue a career in commercial law will have taken the opportunity to further their knowledge in this area through choosing relevant modules, when the opportunity has arisen."
